          Tarriona “Tank” Ball is the front woman of Tank and the Bangas who got her start in the slam poetry scene of New Orleans. Norah and Tank are by all means ‘friend goals’ so they cover everything from the news, to cooking, writing, attending the GRAMMYs and of course love. The music in this episode takes some surprising turns while they play new versions of songs by Tank like ‘Rollercoasters’ & ‘Friend Goals,’ a collaboration with Norah titled ‘Playing Along’ and in a twist, a new take on ‘Don’t Know Why.’Learn more about your ad choices.
